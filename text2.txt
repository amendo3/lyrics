"[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]




O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty

O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty




O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy

Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay

Now we out in Paris, yeah, I'm Perrierin'

Get–get–get–get–get–gettin' hot, Californicatin'
I give her that D, 'cause that's where I was born and raised in
